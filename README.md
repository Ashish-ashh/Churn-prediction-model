## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts **customer churn** (whether a customer will leave a service) using machine learning.  
It is aimed at helping businesses **reduce churn** and **improve customer retention**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Business Problem
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses.  
By identifying customers likely to leave, companies can take preventive action like:
- Offering discounts
- Improving customer service
- Personalizing marketing campaigns

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [[WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv](../../Downloads/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv)]  

- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

Key features used:
- Tenure  
- Monthly Charges  
- Contract Type  
- Internet Service  
- Payment Method  
- gender
- SeniorCitizen
- Dependents
- PhoneService
- etc...

## ðŸ”§ Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Handled missing values
   - Visualized churn distribution
   - Encoded categorical variables
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created derived features (if any)
   - Standardized numerical columns
3. **Model Building**
   - Tried multiple models ( Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Tuned hyperparameters
   - Selected the best-performing model
4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **Best Model:** `Random Forest Classifier` (or whichever you used)
- **Accuracy:** `80%`
- **F1-Score:** `80`
